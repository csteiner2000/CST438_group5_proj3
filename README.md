Description: For this project our team will develop a Notepad application where users will be able to view and access notes across web and mobile applications. The application will be developed using frameworks that are common in tech today. This will require the development of a Representational state transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API), a constant integration, and a persistence layer. The website will be deployed on Heroku. This repository will contain the code base for the web application. The web app will feature a web database using Heroku. Node.js will be the JS framework used to design the API and backend.

API: In Progress
